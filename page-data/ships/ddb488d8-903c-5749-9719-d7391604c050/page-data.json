Near the stern there is evidence of overhanging sponsons. The propeller which would likely be an early design is missing. The machinery includes a haystack boiler, feedwater pre-heater and single expansion steam engine of identical design to those on the propeller Indiana which were removed by the Smithsonian Museum team. The disarticulated aft deck appears to be hanging off the stern with the propeller shaft hanger bearing rods. There is an anchor windlass with an elevated rocker arm which was probably operated from the forecastle deck or spar deck, anchors sitting on the deck, part of the mast, and a capstan and bit on the stern. The sides of the ship are also extant on site laying on the bottom next to the hull. There are two cargo winches with frames on the port side near the engine and several hand carts scattered around the site.","Vessel_Type":"Propeller","Year_Built":"","Year_Sank":""}},"pageContext":{"id":"ddb488d8-903c-5749-9719-d7391604c050"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
