The cabin window framing, bitts, and parts of benches still exist and the stack is stuck into one of the openings in the deck.  Visibility is best under the ice and early spring.  During the season high speed recreational boat traffic makes the site somewhat risky to dive.","Vessel_Type":"Streetcar Ferry Boat","Year_Built":"","Year_Sank":""}},"pageContext":{"id":"328fd487-0547-5ccd-907c-2d6c9dc8cedc"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
