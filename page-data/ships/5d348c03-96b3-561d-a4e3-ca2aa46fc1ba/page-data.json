Unfortunately apparently a local dive group moved a 20th century wreck which was originally on the other side of the harbor and deposited on the Traveller site. Both ships burned so it is difficult to sort out which wreckage is from which wreck. What appears to be from the Traveller is the side of the hull embedded in the gravel and the bottom of the ship near the stem. There is also one of the triangle shaped sidewheel bearing supports on site. There are obvious signs of burned planking on some of the sections.","Vessel_Type":"Sidewheel Steamer","Year_Built":"1852","Year_Sank":"1865"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5d348c03-96b3-561d-a4e3-ca2aa46fc1ba"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
