Its bow was cut off during the collision with the steamer Keystate. It is in about 60 to 70 feet of water. The hull is in reasonable shape with its decking and holds still visible. The top of the deck is pulled to the side of the hull. This either happened at the time of the collision or afterwards when it may have been hooked by a ship’s anchor. The masts were cut off to about 3 feet above the deck. The ship’s rudder is still intact but the ship’s wheel was removed by scuba divers in the 1970s.","Vessel_Type":"Schooner","Year_Built":"1889","Year_Sank":"1929"}},"pageContext":{"id":"296f2d3d-4dfa-5d91-83dc-3b461aaa5166"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
