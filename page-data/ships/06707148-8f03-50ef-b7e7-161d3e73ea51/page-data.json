The stem and stern sit upright while the sides are laying with inner sides up and visible. There are two unique features about this wreck. It is a double centerboard vessel and both centerboard trunks are visible on site. The centerboard, although broken, is visible projecting from one of the trunks. The other feature is the hogging arch, embedded in the hull, arches downward rather than upward as is the common way of being constructed.","Vessel_Type":"Barkentine","Year_Built":"1863","Year_Sank":"1874"}},"pageContext":{"id":"06707148-8f03-50ef-b7e7-161d3e73ea51"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
