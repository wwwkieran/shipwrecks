Named after Sir Oliver Mowat, one of the Fathers of Confederation her career would span 48 years until her collision on September 1st, 1921 with the steamer KEYWEST. At that time there were only 400 sailing ships left registered on the Great Lakes, so she represents the last of the three-masted schooner era. Since her loss in 1921, she has been considered the holy grail for shipwreck hunters of the region. After 25 years of searching, her location was discovered on June 12th, 1996 by Barbara Carson, Tim Legate, Spencer Shoniker and the Late Rick Neilson along with their friends Susan Donnelly and David Teeple. The location was kept secret to protect the numerous artifacts ranging from twin anchors at the bow to the ship’s wheel aft. On deck, everything from oil lanterns to crockery could be seen. Over the years only a select few have been able to dive this time capsule of history. In the summer of 2023, Kayla Martin led an expedition funded by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society to document the wreck. The team operated under a Marine Archaeology License from the Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism and with the support of Save Ontario Shipwrecks and the Ontario Marine Heritage Committee. Today the wreck sits upright on the bottom in 121 feet of water.  The bowsprit is intact with the port anchor in place on deck and the starboard anchor hanging from its cathead. The ship’s wheel is upright and on deck can be seen the windless, donkey boiler, steam powered winch along with pulleys, deadeyes and a fife rail with belaying pins. Late in the 2023 season Kayla and her team working with the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) placed a CCG approved mooring block at the site. In the spring of 2024, Kayla will deploy a CCG approved buoy at the site so the diving public can access the wreck while protecting the site from anchor damage.","Vessel_Type":"Schooner","Year_Built":"1873","Year_Sank":"1921"}},"pageContext":{"id":"baaf8523-ef8d-5a4b-944e-b66df24c0d32"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
