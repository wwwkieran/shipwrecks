The hull construction is unique for an 1856 build because there are wooden hogging arches embedded in the sides of the hull curving both up and down. The port side bow is intact with a boom leaning against it and the broken windlass, two anchors, centerboard, a capstan, winch, and stove are extant on the site.","Vessel_Type":"Schooner","Year_Built":"1856","Year_Sank":"1864"}},"pageContext":{"id":"976ee467-cf4e-5f4e-b66c-96be90596154"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
