All of the superstructure was removed before it was scuttled so is not extant on the site. The forward and aft decks are intact as well as a ventilator cowl on the aft deck and two bits.  Visibility is best under the ice and early spring.  During the season high speed recreational boat traffic makes the site somewhat risky to dive.","Vessel_Type":"Passenger Vessel","Year_Built":"1906","Year_Sank":"1926"}},"pageContext":{"id":"ab32fd8c-bb62-5477-8ccc-5e7dc018bdb7"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
