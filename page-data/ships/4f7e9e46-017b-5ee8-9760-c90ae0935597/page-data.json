The wreck is just offshore at the foot of Market Street in downtown Alexandria Bay, N.Y. The wooden wreck is much deteriorated. Resting on the slope of the bottom, it is close to being parallel with shore. The wreck is from 30 to 45 feet deep, with some timbers as deep as 60 feet. This is a maintained dive site by Seaway Trails and car parking and water access are available. It is a nice shore dive up stream off the hospital along or downstream the side of Cornwall Brothers Store and Museum.","Vessel_Type":"Side-Wheeler","Year_Built":"1871","Year_Sank":"1909"}},"pageContext":{"id":"4f7e9e46-017b-5ee8-9760-c90ae0935597"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
