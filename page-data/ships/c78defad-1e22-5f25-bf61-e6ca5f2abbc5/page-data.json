Most of the wreck was buried under shifting sands. The boiler, part of the propeller, shaft log and deadwood, and parts of the sides of the ship was all that could be seen above the sand. Although the two major bottom sections appear contiguous in the model there was a break in the imagery between the two sections estimated to be around 30 ft so the two sections were manually joined to save space in the model. The orientation of the two sections is also not precise.","Vessel_Type":"Package Freighter","Year_Built":"1875","Year_Sank":"1888"}},"pageContext":{"id":"c78defad-1e22-5f25-bf61-e6ca5f2abbc5"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
