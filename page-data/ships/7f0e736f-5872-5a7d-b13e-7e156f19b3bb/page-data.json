Fifty years ago the whole wreck including the propeller was exposed until one stormy winter buried much of wreck. At the time of the model much of the hull and deck was exposed. The wooden hull is very intact. The foredeck has collapsed along with a small section of the main deck but most of the deck is intact. There is much machinery extant on site including capstans, bitts, towing bitt, the somewhat rare double piston single expansion steam engine, steel boiler cabin, deck winch, two mast stubs, one with a fife-rail, and a sail boom.","Vessel_Type":"Steambarge","Year_Built":"1880","Year_Sank":"1889"}},"pageContext":{"id":"7f0e736f-5872-5a7d-b13e-7e156f19b3bb"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
