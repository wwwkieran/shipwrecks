Masts and tops, spars, and booms are scattered on the deck and beside the wreck. The windlass, anchors, catheads, capstan, centerboard winch, some cabin structure, the rudder, and the ships wheel are extant on site. There are also stoves, and railroad rails on the deck and in the hold although mostly buried in silt. The collision damage is visible on the starboard side.","Vessel_Type":"Barkentine","Year_Built":"1853","Year_Sank":"1854"}},"pageContext":{"id":"de35b6cf-e606-5c5d-b62b-4cf37dd21c34"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
