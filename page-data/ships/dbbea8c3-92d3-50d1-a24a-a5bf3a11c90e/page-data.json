It is the only schooner in Lake Superior with standing masts.  It is unclear if the mizzen mast broke at the time of sinking or was removed prior to sinking.  The aft cabins are gone but it does have forward cabins with a donkey boiler.  Two wood stock anchors lie on the forecastle deck.  The name is clearly visible on the starboard side of the bow and the broken transom.","Vessel_Type":"","Year_Built":"1861","Year_Sank":"1897"}},"pageContext":{"id":"dbbea8c3-92d3-50d1-a24a-a5bf3a11c90e"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
