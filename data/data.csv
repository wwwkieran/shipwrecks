Oliver Mowat,Unknown,Unknown,Oliver-Mowat-Thumbnail-2023.jpg,Ontario,Wood,"The three-masted schooner OLIVER MOWAT (Canadian No. 92584) was considered the crown jewel of the Millhaven shipyards when she was launched on July 16th, 1873. Named after Sir Oliver Mowat, one of the Fathers of Confederation her career would span 48 years until her collision on September 1st, 1921 with the steamer KEYWEST. At that time there were only 400 sailing ships left registered on the Great Lakes, so she represents the last of the three-masted schooner era. Since her loss in 1921, she has been considered the holy grail for shipwreck hunters of the region. After 25 years of searching, her location was discovered on June 12th, 1996 by Barbara Carson, Tim Legate, Spencer Shoniker and the Late Rick Neilson along with their friends Susan Donnelly and David Teeple. The location was kept secret to protect the numerous artifacts ranging from twin anchors at the bow to the ship’s wheel aft. On deck, everything from oil lanterns to crockery could be seen. Over the years only a select few have been able to dive this time capsule of history. In the summer of 2023, Kayla Martin led an expedition funded by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society to document the wreck. The team operated under a Marine Archaeology License from the Ministry of Citizenship and Multiculturalism and with the support of Save Ontario Shipwrecks and the Ontario Marine Heritage Committee. Today the wreck sits upright on the bottom in 121 feet of water.  The bowsprit is intact with the port anchor in place on deck and the starboard anchor hanging from its cathead. The ship’s wheel is upright and on deck can be seen the windless, donkey boiler, steam powered winch along with pulleys, deadeyes and a fife rail with belaying pins. Late in the 2023 season Kayla and her team working with the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) placed a CCG approved mooring block at the site. In the spring of 2024, Kayla will deploy a CCG approved buoy at the site so the diving public can access the wreck while protecting the site from anchor damage.",1873,1921,None,Schooner,CA,"[""https://greatlakes.bgsu.edu/item/438212""]",Ontario,92584,121 ft.,https://3dshipwrecks.org/shipwreck-oliver-mowat/,https://sketchfab.com/models/80f787dd9a464da0a17429902149e320/embed,September 2023,25.9 ft,131.2 ft,[]

In 1918 the ship was bought by Hammermill Paper Company renamed to Harriet B after the owner Ernst Berhrend’s daughter.  Her operational status was changed to freight operating between Erie PA and Lake Superior.  She would carry pulpwood downbound and return with coal.

George M. Cox aka Puritan,Unknown,Unknown,CoxSternSite1999-e1584291855128.jpg,Michigan,Steel,"The George M. Cox was built as the Puritan which had a long operational history in the passenger transportation business mainly between Chicago, Holland and Benton Harbor. It was acquired but the US Navy in 1918 for service in WWI. It returned to the Great Lakes for service in 1920. After sitting idle for four years during the Great Depression in 1933 millionaire George M. Cox bought the Puritan for service between Chicago, Houghton, Isle Royale and Port Arthur. After a total refit the now elegant Puritan was renamed the George M. Cox after its owner. It was on its maiden voyage with its owner on board that it grounded on Rock of Ages shoal. Striking the reef at a speed of 17 knots lifted an estimated 110 feet of her keel out of the water. All 125 passengers and crew were rescued by the lighthouse keeper and spent an uncomfortable night huddled on the lighthouse spiral staircase. The wreck site is composed of two major areas — the deeper mid-section and stern which sits on the slope of Rock of Ages reef and the bow section which is in the shallows on top of the reef.\xa0 The stern and mid-section part lies mostly on its port side but twists toward the stern to totally upside-down.\xa0 The top of the engine can be seen under the side of the ship and the propeller and shaft protrude from under the wreck at the deeper end of the ship.\xa0 The bow section in the shallows contains the anchors, windlass and chains and the crushed chain locker portion of the bow.\xa0 Disjoint wreckage and pieces of the sides are scattered on top of the shoal and mark the way from the deeper section to the shallow area.",1901,1933,,Propeller,US,"[""https://greatlakes.bgsu.edu/item/440144"", ""https://www.superiortrips.com/Cox_Shipwreck.htm""]",Superior,150898,22 ft,https://3dshipwrecks.org/shipwreck-george-m-cox/,https://sketchfab.com/models/96c709580cf64153b2d7769ff4a8daa3/embed,,40 ft,233 ft,[]
